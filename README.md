[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/hexo-next-publist.png)](https://npmjs.org/package/hexo-next-publist)

Show a list of publications anywhere in the markdown post. There is also a customizable panel to filter the results.

## Demo

The research page in my [my blog](https://unlimited-code.works/research) are generated by this plugin. Please go and take a look.
The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/Aetf/Aetf.github.io).

## Installation

`npm i -S hexo-next-publist`

This will install `hexo-next-publist` and add it as a dependency in your `package.json`.

NOTE: There are also several peer dependencies you may need to install.
Follow the instruction printed when running the previous command to install the missing ones.

## Usage

There are three pieces need to be defined:

1. The actual tag, which also defines the set of conferences
2. The bib source file, which defines the list of publications
3. The publication assets directory, which contains the (optional) downloadable files

### Tag usage

First of all, you need to add
```yaml
publist: true
```
to the front-matter of the post/page that you wish to use the publist tag.
For performance reasons, publist will not inject supplimentary js and css unless told to do so.

To insert publist, use the `publist` tag in the post markdown source.
The only argument in the opening tag is the name of bib file.

The content between the tags defines any conferences the bibtex file will refer. [More examples](#instance-options-between-the-tags).

```yaml
{% publist mypubs %}
version: 2
pub_dir: assets/pub
highlight_authors: []
# extra filters to show, they will filter on the item using given path
extra_filters: []
venues:
  MLSys:
    category: Conferences
    occurances:
    # key is used in publist_confkey, must be unique across conferences
    - key: MLSys'20
      # conference full name
      name: The 3rd Conference on Machine Learning and Systems
      # conference date for sorting (optional)
      date: 2020-03-02
      # conference website (optional)
      url: https://mlsys.org/Conferences/2020
      # conference acceptance rate (optional)
      acceptance: 19.2%
{% endpublist %}
```


### Bib source file
Bib source files are treated as data sources, so they need to be placed in the `source/_data` folder. You can then refer to them via the file name when using the `publist` tag.

You'll need to add some [publist specific fields](#extra-fields-in-bib-source) in the bib file to control the handling, and they will be striped out when shown in the UI.

<details>
  <summary>Example bib file</summary>
  <p>

```bibtex
@inproceedings{yu20mlsys,
    title = {{Salus}: Find-grained {GPU} Sharing primitives for Deep Learning Applications},
    author = {Yu, Peifeng and Chowdhury, Mosharaf},
    booktitle = {Proceedings of the 3rd Conference on Machine Learning and Systems},
    year = {2020},

    publist_confkey = {MLSys'20},
    publist_link = {paper || yu20mlsys.pdf},
    publist_link = {talk || yu20mlsys-talk.pptx},
    publist_link = {poster || yu20mlsys-poster.pdf},
    publist_badge = {Artifacts Available},
    publist_badge = {Artifacts Evaluated Functional},
    publist_badge = {Artifacts Replicated},
    publist_abstract = {
      This is an abstract.

      The common spaces before each line will be stripped.
    }
    publist_tag = {tagA},
    publist_tag = {tagB},
    publist_topic = {Deep Learning},
    publist_topic = {GPU},
}
```
  </p>
</details>

### Publication Assets Directory
Set by `pub_dir` in the instance options.

The `publist_link` field in the bib source refers to files in this directory.

One subfolder following the entry key per entry, containing slides, pdf, or any additional files.

If the link part starts with `/`, then it is intepreted as an absolute path.

If the link starts with `http`, then it is used as is.

### Configuration

#### Instance options between the tags

The full spec of this content is defined as a [JSON schema](blob/master/src/schema_instopts.json).

<details>
  <summary>Example config with comments</summary>
  <p>

```yaml
{% publist mypubs %}
# the version of the config
version: 2
pub_dir: assets/pub
highlight_authors: []
# extra filters to show, they will filter on the item using given path
extra_filters:
  - name: Topic
    path: meta.topic
  - name: Badge
    path: badges
venues:
  MLSys:
    category: Conferences
    occurances:
    # key is used in publist_confkey, must be unique across conferences
    - key: MLSys'20
      # conference full name
      name: The 3rd Conference on Machine Learning and Systems
      # conference date for sorting (optional. If this is missing, the year and month in bib entry will be used)
      date: 2020-03-02
      # conference website (optional. Will use an url from the parent level if there's one)
      url: https://mlsys.org/Conferences/2020
      # conference acceptance rate (optional)
      acceptance: 19.2%
  arXiv:
    category: Technical Reports
    # url can also be set on the whole (optional)
    url: https://arxiv.org
    occurances:
    - key: arXiv-all
      # instead of using key to match confkey in literal,
      # use the regex given here.
      # the key still have to be unique globally
      matches: arXiv:(.*)
      # then the name can refer to capture groups
      name: 'arXiv$1'
      # link, optional, makes the name a url when shown in the UI, can contain capture groups
      link: 'https://arxiv.org/$1'
      # url, optional, can contain capture groups
      url: 'https://arxiv.org/$1'
{% endpublist %}
```
  </p>
</details>

#### Extra fields in bib source

- `publist_link`, `publist_badge`, and `publist_abstract` are optional.
- `publist_link` and `publist_badge` can be specified multiple times.
- The content in `publist_abstract` will be rendered as markdown with support for latex math. If this
field does not present, the normal `abstract` field will be used. However, in this case, the content
will be used verbatim.
- Other fields like `publist_xxx` can be added to attach metadata fields to the entry.

#### Global options in `_config.yml`

```yaml
publist:
  # where should the publist js and css files be served
  # publist will generate its own js and css file under this prefix
  assets_prefix: assets/publist
  # entries within the last `new_months` will be marked new
  new_months: 3
  # if strict mode is enabled, any bibtex parsing errors will be fatal
  strict: false
```


## Internals

- `_config.yml` contains main options under the key `publist`.
- `src/injector.js` injects `templates/{headend,bodyend}.njk` to every page,
but the content will only be inserted if the front-matter contains `publist_enabled: true`
- `src/widget` implements a hexo box, processing all assets under `widget`, and serving them.
- `src/bib-renderer.js` reads `.bib` files under `source/_data` in the user's repo. The result will
be available as data in the data model.
- `src/publist.js` is the actual tag plugin, which reads bib data
from the data model and renders the html.
