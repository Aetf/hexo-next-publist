Show a list of publications anywhere in the markdown post.

## Demo

The research page in my [my blog](https://unlimited-code.works/research) are generated by this plugin. Please go and take a look.
The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/Aetf/Aetf.github.io).

## Installation

`npm i -S hexo-next-publist`

This will install `hexo-next-publist` and add it as a dependency in your `package.json`.

## Usage

### Configuration

`_data/publist.yml`

This contains categories, conference list, and prefix for assets and servable files

The following shows every option:

```yaml
# directory used for relative links in publication items
publication_dir: assets/pub
# where should the publist js and css files be served
# publist will generate its own js and css file under this prefix
assets_prefix: assets/publist
# Map of venue types to venues
venues:
  # key is also used in display
  Conferences:
    # conference short name
    MLSys'20:
      # conference id
      venue: MLSys
      # conference full name
      name: The 3rd Conference on Machine Learning and Systems
      # date for sorting
      date: 2020-03-02
      # conference website (optional)
      url: https://mlsys.org/Conferences/2020
      # conference acceptance rate (optional)
      acceptance: "19.2%"
  Workshops: {}
  Posters: {}
  Demos: {}
  Journals: {}
```

### Servable files

`sources/assets/pub`

One folder per entry, containing bibtex, abstract, pdf, and any additional files

### Tag usage

To insert publist, use the following in the post markdown source.

```bibtex
{% publist %}
@inproceedings{yu20mlsys,
    title = {{Salus}: Find-grained {GPU} Sharing primitives for Deep Learning Applications},
    author = {Yu, Peifeng and Chowdhury, Mosharaf},
    booktitle = {Proceedings of the 3rd Conference on Machine Learning and Systems},
    year = {2020},
    % publist specific settings, they will not show up in the end result
    publist_confkey = {MLSys'20},
    publist_link = {paper || yu20mlsys/yu20mlsys.pdf},
    publist_link = {talk || yu20mlsys/yu20mlsys-talk.pptx},
    publist_link = {poster || yu20mlsys/yu20mlsys-poster.pdf},
    publist_badge = {Artifacts Available},
    publist_badge = {Artifacts Evaluated Functional},
    publist_badge = {Artifacts Replicated},
    publist_abstract = {
        Unlike traditional resources such as CPU or the network, modern GPUs do not natively support
        fine-grained sharing primitives.
        Consequently, implementing common policies such as time sharing and preemption are expensive. Worse,
        when a deep learning (DL) application cannot completely use a GPU's resources, the GPU cannot be efficiently shared
        between multiple applications, leading to GPU underutilization.

        We present Salus to enable two GPU sharing primitives: __fast job
        switching__ and __memory sharing__, to achieve fine-grained GPU sharing
        among multiple DL applications. Salus is an efficient, consolidated
        execution service that exposes the GPU to different DL applications, and it
        enforces fine-grained sharing by performing iteration scheduling and
        addressing associated memory management issues. We show that these primitives
        can then be used to implement flexible sharing policies. Our integration of
        Salus with TensorFlow and evaluation on popular DL jobs shows that Salus
        can improve the average completion time of DL training jobs by 3.19x, GPU utilization for hyper-parameter tuning by 2.38x, and GPU
        utilization of DL inference applications by 42x over not sharing
        the GPU and 7x over NVIDIA MPS with small overhead.

`/path/to/file` is relative to `code_dir` in `_config.yml`.
And inline options have the same format as those used in backtick code blocks.
